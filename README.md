# Brain Tumor Detection
## Overview
This project aims to create an image recognition model for the early detection of brain tumors through MRI analysis, using machine learning to classify scans as either healthy or showing a tumor. The models that we considered for the image classification were a standalone, standard CNN model, VGG-16, and CNN Long Short-Term Memory Model.
